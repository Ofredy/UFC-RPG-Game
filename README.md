# UFC-RPG-Game
A rpg made in Python using Pygame and AWS

I am remaking this game. I first made it in c++. It was sloppy and not that impressive. It was for a class so I did not have the adequate time to make it as polished as I would have liked. So I am remaking it in python. The game will no longer only use the terminal for inputs but have a display with inputs from a mouse. This is done by using pygame.

To run the game you need:
  1. A Python Compiler
  2. Pygame
        - Once python is installed, to get pygame run the command in cmd:
        - pip install pygame
  3. Download the zip file and run the main.py script with all the files in the same folder.
        - For example if downloaded to desktop do:
        - cd Desktop
        - cd ufcGame
        - python main.py
