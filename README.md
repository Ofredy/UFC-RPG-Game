# UFC-RPG-Game
A rpg made in Python using Pygame and AWS

I am remaking making this game. I first made it in c++. It was sloppy and not that impressive. It was for a class so I did not have the adequate time to make it as polished as I would have liked. So I am remaking it in python. The game will no longer only use the terminal for inputs but have a display with inputs from a mouse. This is done by using pygame. Also I will make the game a online multiplayer by using AWS"s gaming servers.

At the moment I am working on the graphics of the game here are the files of my code.

To run the game you need to
  1. Python Compiler
  2. Pygame
        - Once python is installed, to get pygame run the command:
        - pip install pygame
  3. Download the zip file and run the main.py script with all the files in the same folder.
        - For example if downloaded to desktop do:
        - cd Desktop
        - cd ufcGame
        - python main.py
